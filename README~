MONOSPACE FONTS PACK

Here are a bunch of monospace fonts suitable for coding or terminal. The 
install.sh script can be used to install the fonts on Linux. None of
these fonts are my own, but are available freely on the internet. The
zip files are the original packages where I got these fonts from.
